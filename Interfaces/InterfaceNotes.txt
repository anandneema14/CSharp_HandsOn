Interfaces
Need of Interface:
1. Used to achieve loose coupling
2. Used to achieve total abstraction
3. Used to achieve component-based programming
4. Interfaces add a plug and play like architecture into applications

Inheritance in Interfaces:
1. If both derived interface and base interface declares the same member then the base interface member name is hidden by the derived interface member name.

New in Interfaces:
1. In C# 8.0, we can have methods implementation as well in interfaces.
2. This feature is called Default Interface Methods
3. Scenario in which this is useful is, whenever we want to add new functionality to an existing interface, so instead of introducing a breaking change to existing interface we can have a default implementation in the interface and it will be available to all the classes that implemented that interface. 
4. This way all the classes will accept it as default implementation and if any of the class needs to have a different implementation  they can override it.
